Astronomer 🔭 and Data Scientist 🧮 at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, but just another lover of numbers and working with data. I use code at work and in play! After acknowledging my Academic nature of hoarding code, I'm finally uploading the work I've done. Watch this space (pun intended).

## Projects
Most of the projects I work on are private repos or historically for public sector organisations that prohited me from putting code online (don't ask!).

- [12 Plots of Christmas](https://github.com/GABurns/12PlotsChristmas):
Led a team of 5 Data Scientists to produce 12 bespoke Christmas themed visualizations for 
[Exploristics](https://exploristics.com/) Social Media campaign. This resulted content with
an **62 % increase in engagement** metrics from baseline social media content.
- [Lunctime Learning](https://github.com/GABurns/Presentations): A repo containing the slide decks and any associated code for [Exploristics](https://exploristics.com/) lunchtime learning sessions on a range of Data Science topics.
- [Data Viz](https://github.com/GABurns/DataViz): A collection of some misc. data visualizations I've done that may be of interest.
- [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/GABurns/TidyTuesday): Timebound efforts to participate in #TidyTuesday dataviz challenages
